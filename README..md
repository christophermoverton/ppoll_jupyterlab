# 538 Presidential Poll Aggregator

This project processes polling data from FiveThirtyEight (538) to produce national and battleground state poll aggregates. The goal is to offer a streamlined way to analyze U.S. presidential election polling data and calculate aggregated polling results for both national trends and specific battleground states.

## Project Overview

This notebook reads, processes, and analyzes polling data from 538 to derive key insights such as:
- **National polling averages**: The overall sentiment from polls across the entire country.
- **Battleground state averages**: Aggregated results for key battleground states that play a pivotal role in the electoral outcome.

Using polling data scraped or sourced from FiveThirtyEight, this notebook performs data cleaning, processing, and aggregation to present meaningful insights and trends for election analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Key Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `altair`
  - `requests` (if you are pulling data from an API)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: The `requirements.txt` should list necessary dependencies such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `altair`.

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook file (`538pollingdata.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run all cells sequentially to download, process, and analyze the 538 polling data.
3. The final output will show:
   - National polling aggregation: The average polling result across all states.
   - Battleground states polling aggregation: Aggregated polling results for specific battleground states.
   
### Customizing the Analysis

You can modify the following parameters for a more tailored analysis:
- **Polling data source**: The notebook is set to read 538 polling data. You can modify the source URL or use a local polling dataset.
- **Battleground states list**: You can edit the list of battleground states to fit your analysis needs.

### Example

To view national polling trends:

```python
# Example to aggregate national polling data
national_aggregate = aggregate_national_polls(polling_data)
print(national_aggregate)
```

To analyze battleground states:

```python
# Example to aggregate battleground states polling data
battleground_aggregate = aggregate_battleground_polls(polling_data, battleground_states)
print(battleground_aggregate)
```

## Data Description

The notebook processes polling data from FiveThirtyEight. This data includes information such as:
- **Pollster**: The organization that conducted the poll.
- **Date**: The date when the poll was conducted.
- **Sample Size**: The number of respondents in the poll.
- **National/Battleground**: Whether the poll is national or related to a specific state.
- **Polling Results**: The percentage of respondents supporting each candidate.

### Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the notebook:
- Removes invalid or incomplete data entries.
- Normalizes dates for consistency.
- Filters polls based on recency and reliability (e.g., polling methodology, sample size).

## Notebook Structure

1. **Data Loading**: The notebook first loads the polling data, either from a local CSV or through an API request to 538.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**: This section handles missing values, normalizes dates, and filters polls based on user-defined parameters (e.g., poll recency, pollster rating).

3. **National Polling Aggregation**: Computes national averages by aggregating results across all available polls.

4. **Battleground States Aggregation**: Calculates polling aggregates for key battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, etc.

5. **Visualization**: Uses **Altair** to create interactive charts and graphs that visualize national trends and battleground states polling data.

## Visualization with Altair

**Altair** is a declarative statistical visualization library in Python, ideal for creating complex visualizations in a simple and intuitive way. In this notebook, Altair is used to generate interactive visualizations of polling trends.

### Example:

To create a line chart of national polling averages over time:

```python
import altair as alt

# Example chart to visualize national polling data trends
chart = alt.Chart(national_aggregate).mark_line().encode(
    x='date:T',
    y='polling_average:Q',
    color='candidate:N'
).properties(
    title='National Polling Average Over Time'
)

chart.show()
```

Altair's interactivity allows you to hover over data points, zoom in, and explore the polling data trends more closely.

## Results and Outputs

After running the notebook, the following outputs will be generated:
- **National Polling Average**: A summary of polling averages for national presidential election sentiment.
- **Battleground Polling Average**: Polling results aggregated for critical battleground states.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive graphs and charts showing trends in polling data over time, created using **Altair**.

These results can be used to gain insights into the national polling trends and battleground state dynamics leading up to the presidential election.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions can include:
- Enhancements to data aggregation methods.
- Additional polling data sources.
- Improvements to visualizations using **Altair**.
